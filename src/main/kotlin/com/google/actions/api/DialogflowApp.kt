/**
 * Implementation of App for Dialogflow based webhook. Developers must extend
 * this class if they are using Dialogflow (as against ActionsSDK) to handle
 * requests. The DialogflowApp parses the incoming JSON request into an
 * ActionRequest that encapsulates the JSON protocol between Dialogflow and
 * your webhook as described [here](https://developers.google.com/actions/build/json/dialogflow-webhook-json).
 *
 * Note that the value of the @ForIntent annotation must match (case-sensitive)
 * the name of the intent as defined in Dialogflow.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ``` Java
 * class MyActionsApp extends DialogflowApp {
 *
 *   @ForIntent("welcome")
 *   public CompletableFuture<ActionResponse> showWelcomeMessage(
 *      ActionRequest request) {
 *      ResponseBuilder builder = getResponseBuilder();
 *      builder.add("some text");
 *      // Intent handler implementation here.
 *   }
 * ```
